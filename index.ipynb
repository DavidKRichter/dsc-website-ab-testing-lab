This is because the previous statistical test was a contingency test that compared two groups of sample data, whereas the chi square test above treats the control group as a population that the experimental group is being compared against. I think that the chi square contingency test is preferable, since  our control data is a sample, rather than a population, and therefore we want a higher p value.**"

    "In this lab, you continued to get more practice designing and conducting AB tests. This required additional work preprocessing and formulating the initial problem in a suitable manner. Additionally, you also saw how to verify results, strengthening your knowledge of binomial variables, and reviewing initial statistical concepts of the central limit theorem, standard deviation, z-scores, and their accompanying p-values."
